This one is based off an existing CC0 licensed sprite.

The original sprite sheet used 16x16 pixel sprites,
I increased its size from 16x16 to 16x24 and tried
to fix it up manually. I didn't succeed as well
as I hoped.

Old version of my personal pixel hero, Mr. Man! He stands, runs, jumps, lands, kicks, punches, swims, and even comes with a parachute for safe landings!

Modified by The UnDisbeliever so he's 16x24 pixels in size.
